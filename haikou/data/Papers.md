   4. **Abstract:** Recently, the development of data mining and natural language processing techniques enable the relationship probe between social media and stock market volatility. The integration of natural language processing, deep learning and the financial field is irresistible. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for stock market prediction based on tweets embedding  and historical prices. Different from the traditional text embedding  methods, our approach takes the internal semantic features and external  structural characteristics of Twitter data into account, such that the  generated tweet vectors can contain more effective information.  Specifically, we develop a Tweet Node algorithm for describing potential connection in Twitter data through constructing the tweet node network. Further, our model supplements emotional attributes to the Twitter  representations, which are input into a deep learning model based on  attention mechanism together with historical stock price. In addition,  we designed a visual interactive stock prediction tool to display the  result of the prediction.

   4. **Abstract:** Stock price movement prediction is an important task of the financial  prediction field. The current mainstream approaches usually apply  financial texts and some corresponding stock price information to  predict the stock price movement. However, the current methods usually  suffer from two shortcomings: (1) To reduce the stochasticity in the  stock price and financial text information, some researchers adopt [generative models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/generative-model) to better treat the stochasticity while enduring the overfitting  problem during training. (2) Although the current state-of-the-art  methods based on the [generative adversarial network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/generative-adversarial-networks) have been proposed to reduce the overfitting, they only concentrate on  the overfitting problem of the stock price information and neglect the  above problem of financial text information with higher stochasticity.  In this paper, we propose a self-regulated generative adversarial  network by combining the generative adversarial network and cooperative  network for the stock price movement prediction. Furthermore, the  proposed model can effectively reduce the stochasticity and overfitting  problems simultaneously for the stock price and the financial text  information. The experimental results on the currently commonly used  stock dataset based on tweets confirm that the proposed method can  achieve the novelly state-of-the-art performance compared with some  current advances.

3. **FAST: Financial News and Tweet Based Time Aware Network for Stock Trading**

   1. Code: No
   2. Year: 2021
   3. **Journal/Conference:** EACL 2021
   4. **Abstract: **Designing profitable trading strategies is complex as stock  movements are highly stochastic; the market is influenced by large  volumes of noisy data across diverse information sources like news and  social media. Prior work mostly treats stock movement prediction as a  regression or classification task and is not directly optimized towards  profit-making. Further, they do not model the fine-grain temporal  irregularities in the release of vast volumes of text that the market  responds to quickly. Building on these limitations, we propose a novel  hierarchical, learning to rank approach that uses textual data to make  time-aware predictions for ranking stocks based on expected profit. Our  approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 8% in terms of  cumulative profit and risk-adjusted returns in trading simulations on  two benchmarks: English tweets and Chinese financial news spanning two  major stock indexes and four global markets. Through ablative and  qualitative analyses, we build the case for our method as a tool for  daily stock trading.

   4. **Abstract:** Given historical stock prices and sparse tweets, how can we accurately  predict stock price movement? Many market analysts strive to use a large amount of information for stock price prediction, and Twitter is one of the richest sources of information presenting real-time opinions of  people. However, previous works that use tweet data in stock movement  prediction have suffered from two limitations. First, the number of  tweets is heavily biased towards only a few popular stocks, and most  stocks have insufficient evidence for accurate price prediction. Second, many tweets provide noisy information irrelevant of actual price  movement, and extracting reliable information from tweets is as  challenging as predicting stock prices.In this paper, we propose SLOT  (Self-supervised Learning of Tweets for Capturing Multi-level Price  Trends), an accurate method for stock movement prediction. SLOT has two  main ideas to address the limitations of previous tweet-based models.  First, SLOT learns embedding vectors of stocks and tweets in the same  semantic space through self-supervised learning. The embeddings allow us to use all available tweets to improve the prediction for even  unpopular stocks, addressing the sparsity problem. Second, SLOT learns  multi-level relationships between stocks from tweets, rather than using  them as direct evidence for prediction, making it robust to the  unreliability of tweets. Extensive experiments on real world datasets  show that SLOT provides the state-of-the-art accuracy of stock movement  prediction.

   4. **Abstract:** 

      ### Purpose

      With the ascendance of information  technology, particularly through the internet, external information  sources and their impacts can be readily transferred to influence the  performance of financial markets within a short period of time. The  purpose of this paper is to investigate how incidents affect stock  prices and volatility using vector error correction and  autoregressive-generalized auto regressive conditional  Heteroskedasticity models, respectively.

      ### Design/methodology/approach

      To characterize the investors’ responses to  incidents, the authors introduce indices derived using search volumes  from Google Trends and the Baidu Index.

      ### Findings

      The empirical results indicate that an  outbreak of disasters can increase volatility temporarily, and exert  significant negative effects on stock prices in a relatively long time.  In addition, indices derived from different search engines show  differentiation, with the Google Trends search index mainly representing international investors and appearing more significant and persistent.

      ### Originality/value

      This study contributes to the existing  literature by incorporating open-source data to analyze how catastrophic events affect financial markets and effect persistence.

   4. **Abstract:** The aim of this paper is to investigate interdependencies between the WIG20  index and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) related keywords quantified by a Google  Trends search index. Tests for two periods from January 2015 till December 2019 and  from June 2016 till May 2021 have been performed. This allowed the period of relative  stability from the time of economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemics followed by various restrictions imposed by the governments to be distinguished. A bivariate VAR model to selected search terms and the value of the WIG20 index  was applied. After using AIC to establish the optimal number of lags the Granger causality test was performed. The increased empirical relationship has been confirmed between twelve EPU related terms and changes in the WIG20 index in the second period  versus six terms for the pre-COVID period. It was also found that in the post-COVID  period the intensity of reverse relations increased.

   4. **Abstract:** Stock prediction via market  data analysis is an attractive research topic. Both stock prices and  news articles have been employed in the prediction processes. However,  how to combine technical indicators from stock prices and news  sentiments from textual news articles, and make the prediction model be  able to learn sequential information within [time series](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/time-series) in an intelligent way, is still an [unsolved problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/unsolved-problem). In this paper, we build up a stock prediction system and propose an  approach that 1) represents numerical price data by technical indicators via technical analysis, and represents textual news articles by  sentiment vectors via [sentiment analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/sentiment-analysis), 2) setup a layered [deep learning model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/deep-learning-model) to learn the sequential information within market snapshot series which is constructed by the technical indicators and news sentiments, 3)  setup a fully connected [neural network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network) to make stock predictions. Experiments have been conducted on more than five years of Hong Kong Stock Exchange data using four different  sentiment dictionaries, and results show that 1) the proposed approach  outperforms the baselines in both validation and test sets using two  different [evaluation metrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/evaluation-metric), 2) models incorporating prices and news sentiments outperform models  that only use either technical indicators or news sentiments, in both  individual stock level and sector level, 3) among the four sentiment  dictionaries, finance domain-specific sentiment dictionary  (Loughran–McDonald Financial Dictionary) models the news sentiments  better, which brings more prediction performance improvements than the  other three dictionaries.

8. **Asymmetric dependence between stock market returns and news during COVID-19 financial turmoil**

   1. **Code:** No
   2. **Year:** 2020
   3. **Journal/Conference:** Finance Research Letters
   4. **Abstract:** The impact of public news sentiment on stock returns has received increasing attention in recent years. A growing body of empirical and theoretical studies has focused on understanding whether price movements in financial markets are driven by economic or political news (Smales, 2014; Broadstock and Zhang, 2019; Shi and Ho, 2020). The consensus is that the information arriving from social media channels exerts a significant influence on the stock market dynamic, especially in times of economic or political uncertainty. Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the considerable amount of related news, stock markets around the world have suffered enormous losses in the first three months of 2020. According to Bloomberg, “through 1 p.m. on March 18, the S&P 500 index was off 27% for the year to date, Germany's DAX was down 38% and Japan's Nikkei was off 29%.” Consequently, the governments around the world have undertaken a series of stimulus packages to offset the damages produced by the pandemic and to regain investor's confidence. Although the major stock market indexes have partially recovered in the middle of April 2020, a great deal of financial uncertainty remains. While the current literature relating the COVID-19 pandemic to financial markets is limited, the existing studies have provided some very interesting results. For example, Corbet et al. (2020a) reveal a negative knock-on impact from the coronavirus on some companies with similar names. In addition, Akhtaruzzaman et al. (2020), show that listed firms across China and G7 countries have experienced significant increases in the conditional correlations for the market returns. This fact is confirmed by Okorie and Lin (2020) which found considerable fractal contagion on the market return and market volatility. Moreover, Conlon and McGee (2020) and Goodell and Goutte (2020) suggest that cryptocurrencies do not act like safe havens during COVID-19 turmoil. In this paper, I contribute to the literature by investigating the stock market's reaction to coronavirus news in the top six most affected countries by the pandemic1 . By employing a panel quantile regression model, I show that the stock markets present asymmetric dependencies with COVID-19 related information. Specifically, the fake news exerts a negative influence on the lower and the middle quantiles throughout the distribution of returns; however, their impact is not statistically significant for the extreme values. Moreover, the media coverage leads to a decrease in returns across middle and upper quantiles and has no effects on the lower ones. Similarly, the financial contagion across companies is detrimental to returns from 50th to 75th quantiles. Furthermore, the estimates show that the gold price dynamic has a nonlinear impact on equity markets, especially during extreme bearish and bullish markets. The rest of the paper has the following structure: Section 2 presents the data, Section 3 discusses the econometric approach, and the results are in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.

9. **Stock market prediction using machine learning classifiers and social media, news**

   4. **Abstract:** Accurate stock market prediction is of great interest to investors;  however, stock markets are driven by volatile factors such as microblogs and news that make it hard to predict stock market index based on  merely the historical data. The enormous stock market volatility  emphasizes the need to effectively assess the role of external factors  in stock prediction. Stock markets can be predicted using machine  learning algorithms on information contained in social media and  financial news, as this data can change investors’ behavior. In this  paper, we use algorithms on social media and financial news data to  discover the impact of this data on stock market prediction accuracy for ten subsequent days. For improving performance and quality of  predictions, feature selection and spam tweets reduction are performed  on the data sets. Moreover, we perform experiments to find such stock  markets that are difficult to predict and those that are more influenced by social media and financial news. We compare results of different  algorithms to find a consistent classifier. Finally, for achieving  maximum prediction accuracy, deep learning is used and some classifiers  are ensembled. Our experimental results show that highest prediction  accuracies of 80.53% and 75.16% are achieved using social media and  financial news, respectively. We also show that New York and Red Hat  stock markets are hard to predict, New York and IBM stocks are more  influenced by social media, while London and Microsoft stocks by  financial news. Random forest classifier is found to be consistent and  highest accuracy of 83.22% is achieved by its ensemble.

    4. **Abstract:** Natural Language Processing(NLP) demonstrates a great potential to support financial decision-making by analyzing the text from social media or news outlets. In this work, we build a platform to study the NLP-aided stock auto-trading algorithms systematically. In contrast to the previous work, our platform is characterized by three features: (1) We provide financial news for each specific stock. (2) We provide various stock factors for each stock. (3) We evaluate performance from more financial-relevant metrics. Such a design allows us to develop and evaluate NLP-aided stock auto-trading algorithms in a more realistic setting. In addition to designing an evaluation platform and dataset collection, we also made a technical contribution by proposing a system to automatically learn a good feature representation from various input information. The key to our algorithm is a method called semantic role labeling Pooling (SRLP), which leverages Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) to create a compact representation of each news paragraph. Based on SRLP, we further incorporate other stock factors to make the final prediction. In addition, we propose a self-supervised learning strategy based on SRLP to enhance the out-of-distribution generalization performance of our system. Through our experimental study, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance and outperforms all the baselines' annualized rate of return as well as the maximum drawdown of the CSI300 index and XIN9 index on real trading.
